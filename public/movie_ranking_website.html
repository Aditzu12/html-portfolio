<h1>The Best Movies According to Aditzu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3rd place: Abraham Lincoln</h3>
<p>It's a short biography on Abraham Lincoln, the greatest president of all time in my opinion, and how he fought for the 13th amendament</p>
<h3>2nd place: Schindeler's List</h3>
<p>It's a story of an entreprenour, how had to 'kill' his business to safe thousands and thousands of jews from the Nazi's rule</p>
<h3>1st place: The Great Gatsby</h3>
<p>My all time favorite, it describes how far the love of a man can go,
 years and years of struggle, just to have a chance to get the woman you've 
 been dreaming</p>
 <p>'So we beat on, boats against the current, bored back, ceaseleesly, into the past'</p>
